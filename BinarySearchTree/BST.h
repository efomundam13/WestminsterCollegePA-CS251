/*
Standard implementation would have the deleted nodes actually
gone versus lazy deletion just sets a boolean value to true 
if its deleted buy it is not truly deleted.

Lazy Deletion causes issues because the nodes aren't
really deleted but insead marked as deleted. The issue occurs
when a specific number of nodes are marked deleted and they
slow down the search times to find nodes.
